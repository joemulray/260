Didnt include the test-set.py figured we did not need to submit and had own version. Some reason was giving me import errors when trying to compile ./test-set.py dont know if thats because of the naming of the file or someother case, but worked when doing python test-set.py just letting you know didnt know if i was the only one. Also did not attempt the extra credit for this homework.
